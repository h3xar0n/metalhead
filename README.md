# Metal Test

No setup or library needed, just download and enjoy! Vue was used for the dropdown menu, and as you know, Lottie was used for the animation.

## Note on the animation

iFrame is definitely not an ideal solution. In the interests of time and getting a visually complete prototype, this was a quick fix as opposed to pasting the demo code or importing it (which wasn't CORS compliant here). With a system such as Webpack and a framework such as Vue, it would be fine to divide huge files and build them together.
